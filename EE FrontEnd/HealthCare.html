                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">Abortion has been one of the most contentious issues in the United States since the Supreme Court upheld abortion rights in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Whoever wins the White House could significantly shape when and under what circumstances women can get the procedure.

                                Recognizing that abortion rights could be vulnerable because of the Supreme Court's ideological shift to the right under President Donald Trump, states are moving quickly. Some are passing laws aimed at provoking a legal challenge to Roe. Others are codifying protections so that abortion remains legal in these states even if Roe is overturned. As a result, Democrats are eager to show voters, particularly women, that they support the Roe decision. While the Democrats are united on that principle, candidates have expressed differing opinions about how involved the government should be in setting limits.</p>

While in the Senate, he voted on to ban a certain late-term abortion procedure as recently as 2003. And a video from 2006 recently emerged in which he said: "I'm a little bit of an odd man out in my party." He has not directly disavowed casting those votes.</td>

                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, extended health coverage to about 20 million Americans, and the presidential candidates agree the government must do more to cover the remaining uninsured.

                                But clear divisions remain on how to achieve that goal. The most progressive candidates say the government should provide health insurance for the vast majority of Americans through a “Medicare for All” system. Others who think that system would be too costly and too jarring for voters have supported more incremental coverage expansions that preserve a larger role for private insurers.</p>
