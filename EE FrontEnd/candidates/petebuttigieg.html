He is one of two combat veterans running for the Democratic Party nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election.

                    After graduating from Harvard University, and then from Pembroke College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship, Buttigieg worked as a consultant at McKinsey and Company.From 2009 to 2017 he served as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy Reserve, attaining the rank of lieutenant and deploying to Afghanistan in 2014.

On April 14, 2019, Buttigieg announced his candidacy in the 2020 United States presidential election, after having formed an exploratory committee in January 2019.His platform includes support for reducing income inequality, pro-environmental policies, cooperation between the Democratic Party and organized labor, universal background checks for firearms purchases, the Equality Act, and preserving the DACA program for children of illegal immigrants. Buttigieg also supports reforms that would end gerrymandering, overturn the Citizens United v. FEC decision, and abolish the Electoral College.
