                    <li> Description: Stephen Clark Bullock (born April 11, 1966) is an American politician, attorney and former professor serving as the 24th and current Governor of Montana since 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party.

                    Born in Missoula, Montana, Bullock graduated from Claremont McKenna College and Columbia Law School. He began his career working as legal counsel to the Secretary of State of Montana before becoming the Executive Assistant Attorney General and acting Chief Deputy Attorney General of Montana. Bullock then entered private practice as an attorney for Steptoe & Johnson. He was an adjunct professor at the George Washington University Law School before opening his own law firm upon returning to Montana. In 2008, Bullock was elected Attorney General of Montana, and he served one term from 2009 to 2013.

                    Bullock declared his candidacy for Governor of Montana on September 7, 2011. The seat was open in 2012, as incumbent Governor Brian Schweitzer, a Democrat, could not seek reelection due to term limits. Bullock won the Democratic primary with 87% of the vote and defeated Republican nominee Rick Hill in the general election with 48% of the vote. In 2016, Bullock won re-election with 50.2% of the vote, defeating Republican nominee Greg Gianforte.

                    Bullock chaired the National Governors Association from 2018 to 2019. He is a Democratic candidate for President of the United States in 2020. </li>
