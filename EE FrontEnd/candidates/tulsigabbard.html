                    <li> Description: Tulsi Gabbard (born April 12, 1981) is an American politician and military combat veteran serving as the U.S. Representative for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district. She is a member of the Democratic Party. Elected in 2012, Gabbard became the first Samoan American and Hindu member of Congress.

                    Gabbard served in the Hawaii House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004. Elected at age 21, she was the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature. Gabbard served in a field medical unit of the Hawaii Army National Guard in a combat zone in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and was deployed to Kuwait from 2008 to 2009.

                    Gabbard was a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2013 to 2016, when she resigned to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.

                    Gabbard is a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president of the United States in 2020. Her domestic policy platform is economically and socially progressive and has been described as "similar to Bernie Sanders â€¦ in many respects". She supports abortion rights and Medicare for All. Though she voted and lobbied against LGBT rights until 2004, she now supports same-sex marriage in the United States. Gabbard opposes military interventionism, but has called herself a "hawk" on terrorism. Her decision to meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and expressions of skepticism about his use of chemical weapons in the Syrian Civil War attracted controversy. </li>
