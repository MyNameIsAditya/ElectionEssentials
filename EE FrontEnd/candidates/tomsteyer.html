                    <li> Description: Thomas Fahr Steyer (born June 27, 1957) is an American billionaire, hedge fund manager, philanthropist, environmentalist, liberal activist, and fundraiser. He is a candidate in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.

                    Steyer is the founder and former co-senior-managing-partner of Farallon Capital and the co-founder of Onecalifornia Bank, which became (through merger) Beneficial State Bank, an Oakland–based community development bank.[2] Farallon Capital manages $20 billion in capital for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. The firm's institutional investors include college endowments and foundations.Since 1986, Steyer has been a partner and member of the executive committee at Hellman & Friedman, a San Francisco–based $8 billion private equity firm.

                    In 2010, Steyer and his wife signed The Giving Pledge to donate half of their fortune to charity during their lifetime. In 2012, he sold his stake in and retired from Farallon Capital. Switching his focus to politics and the environment, he launched NextGen America, a nonprofit organization that supports progressive positions on climate change, immigration, health care, and education.

                    Steyer served on the board of trustees at Stanford University from 2007 to 2017 </li>
