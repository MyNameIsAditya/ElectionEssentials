                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">Virtually every candidate who has a position on transportation policy believes our roads are congested (and full of potholes), our airports are crammed and our bridges built decades ago need expensive replacements. But where candidates are happy to tell you how they'll spend the money — on broadening highways, on boosting transit, on high speed rail — few have realistic proposals on how to pay for all those new goodies. Not only this but candidates have railed against the poor decisions and infrastructure that led to the water crisis in Flint, Mich. Even then-candidate Donald Trump made a campaign stop there, where he lamented the government failures that created the problem. But then attention quickly faded.

                                It's likely to be an issue again in the 2020 campaign, especially among Democrats eager to burnish their bona fides. The question remains whether any will have substantive ideas for how to fix the problem in Flint — or how to improve aging water and wastewater systems across the country. </p>

She's also called for making all new vehicles electric by 2030 and requiring electric vehicle charging stations at every highway rest stop. She has said she's open to discussing raising the gasoline tax, which currently fuels most federal transportation programs, but worries it "falls hardest on working people … what I really want to see is, I want to see an ultra-millionaire's tax," she told CNN's Jake Tapper. Elizabeth Warren has called for reinstating the Obama-era clean water rule, which sought to more clearly define which waters are considered under the purview of federal clean water regulations. The Trump administration repealed the rule in September 2019. She also says she wants to make big agribusiness pay for polluting air and water systems by closing loopholes in and beefing up enforcement of federal laws.</td>
