The disconnect is a significant concern for voters, who appear to be widely supportive of raising taxes on the wealthy, for example.

                                Democratic presidential candidates are offering a growing list of proposals to tackle the issue, including dramatic steps to redistribute the nation's wealth.
                                
                                Some are offering tax hikes on the wealthy while others propose tax cuts for the middle class. Many support raising the minimum wage, but some are going further by proposing universal basic income and a federal jobs guarantee.</p>
