But most, with a few exceptions, have been light on details on what those new rules should look like.

                                There are subtle differences, however, in how some candidates are approaching the issue, with several floating specific provisions aimed at curtailing companies' data practices or holding industry leaders accountable for privacy mishaps.</p>

Amy Klobuchar, like other 2020 Dems, has called for Congress to enact stronger protections for consumers' personal information online and even introduced her own data privacy legislation.

                                    The idea, known broadly as a "data dividend" or "data tax," would see companies taxed by the government for sharing users' information. Those funds would then be returned to citizens. “If they’re making money off of you, you should make money off of them,” Klobuchar told CBS. “So if they start sharing your data in a big way, we should start taxing them for that and that money should go back to consumers."</td>

                                    Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants CEOs and other company leaders to be held accountable for failures to protect user privacy. The lawmaker has introduced legislation in Congress proposing jail time for corporate executives found liable for data breaches or other privacy violations that affect a certain amount of users, a bold measure that could implicate high-profile CEOs like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg or Google's Sundar Pichai.
                                    
                                    Warren has cast the measure as part of a crackdown she envisions on executive wrongdoing. The bill would empower state and federal regulators to punish executives found liable for privacy violations with up to a year in jail for first-time offenders and up to three years for repeat offenders.</td>

                                    At least one candidate has suggested Congress emulate California's own sweeping online privacy law, considered the toughest in the country. "I favor digital privacy legislation at the federal level very similar to what California has done," former Rep. John Delaney told The New York Times. "I think that's the right framework."
                                    
                                    The California Consumer Privacy Act, set to go into effect in 2020, gives consumers the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information, to request that their data be deleted and to request that companies disclose what information gets collected on them. It allows the state to fine companies for violations and, under certain circumstances, lets individual Californians sue companies for failing to keep their data secure.</td>

Andrew Yang, the former tech entrepreneur who has reached cult-hero status in certain corners of the web, backs this idea. For him, that means users should have the right to opt out of any data collection, to be told if a website has information on them, to have all of their data deleted from a site upon request and to move all their information to another site if desired.</td>

He joined other lawmakers in introducing the bill, the Algorithmic Accountability Act, in April, following reports that Facebook allowed advertisers on its platform to discriminate against users based on race, religion and disability status. The revelation promoted several legal challenges, including a complaint by the Department of Housing and Urban Development that the company violated the Fair Housing Act.</td>
