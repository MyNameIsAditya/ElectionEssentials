                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">The federal government hasn't executed a death row inmate since 2003, but the death penalty remains a key target of several 2020 candidates' criminal justice platforms as momentum begins to shift on the issue. Opposition to the death penalty is at its highest point in almost half a century, according to Gallup polling, though a majority of Americans — 56 percent — continue to support capital punishment for individuals convicted of murder.
                                        Democrats in particular have increasingly turned against the death penalty in recent years, arguing capital punishment is unfairly applied and holding up new technologies that have exonerated death row inmates. They also point to instances of botched executions nationwide. For the first time, the Democratic Party in 2016 formally opposed the death penalty in its party platform.</p>

Proponents of shuttering them also point to data that indicates rehabilitative services at private prisons are less effective and that private prisons aren't substantially cheaper than government-controlled prisons.
                                That same year, the Justice Department sought to end the use of private prisons to house federal inmates, directing the Bureau of Prisons to wind down its use of the contracted for-profit facilities, a move then reversed by Trump's first attorney general early in his administration.</p>
