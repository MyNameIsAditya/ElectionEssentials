                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">President Trump has launched an all-out trade offensive against China in an attempt to pressure Beijing into changing its intellectual property practices and what the White House sees as theft of trade secrets from foreign companies that want to operate in the Chinese market. While there’s support in both parties for the administration’s goal, some say Trump's go-it-alone approach is risky, overly dependent on tariffs, and less effective than a plan that emphasizes working together with allies.</p>
