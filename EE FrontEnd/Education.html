                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">More than 45 million Americans collectively owe some $1.6 trillion in outstanding student-loan debt. Democratic candidates broadly agree that student-loan debt is a burden for many families and is a drag on the economy.

                                The federal government already offers student-loan forgiveness programs for public servants and income-based repayment. Democrats’ positions on how to address existing student-loan debt range from tweaking programs meant to help borrowers to cancelling all of the debt.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">The #RedforEd teacher strike movement ignited in January 2018 with the statewide walkout of West Virginia's teachers. Continuing today, the protests have put a spotlight on inadequate teacher pay and poor classroom conditions.

                                Nearly all the Democratic presidential candidates support raising pay for teachers, but only a handful have offered specifics.</p>

Teachers in the highest-need schools, which disproportionately serve students of color, would see their pay rise even further.</td>

Separately, her campaign has said she plans to raise teacher pay as part of her first 100 days in office and that effort would not be contingent on participation in the partnership.</td>
