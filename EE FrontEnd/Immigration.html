                        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; ">President Trump moved in 2017 to phase out the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers deportation relief and work permits to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Trump's decision — temporarily blocked by federal courts — left the status of nearly 700,000 "Dreamers" in limbo.

                                Democrats criticized the move and will likely strike back with their own proposals to provide a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and a broader pool of undocumented immigrants.</p>
